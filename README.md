# PARTSOL.COM INTERVIEW QUESTIONS
Hello, human.

Your goal is to demonstrate your coding skills by creating a video recording of your answers to some general knowledge questions, writing an ML API demo using Docker, python3, and a bit of magic. Please spend minimal effort on graphics and UI, as this is not a test of your UI coding skills. Just don't stress on frontend stuff.

# 1) GENERAL KNOWLEDGE VIDEO DEMONSTRATION
- Please make a video recording of your answers to the questions in the notebook: https://github.com/daniel-partsol/fizzbuzz/blob/main/Interview_Questions.ipynb
- Please send the video file to alyssa.callahan@partsol.com and cc daniel@lemay.ai
- After you submit the video, proceed to step 2, below.

# 2) MODEL DEPLOYMENT DEMONSTRATION

- Create a container to process inference requests from any pretrained model in the huggingface model hub: https://huggingface.co/models
- Your solution should include server components to support multiple parallel incoming requests (e.g., NGINX/gunicorn)
- Create a notebook to demonstrate requests that POST to the container endpoint and print out the response
- Please explain why you have chosen this model as your demonstration
